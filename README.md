# simple-search
jQuery plugin for searching and filtering in a table

How to use

1. Include the plugin in your page
2. Add the attribute "data-simple-search='on'" to the table(s) that you want the search to be attached to.  Yes, you can have multiple tables on the page and each one of them can have its own search/filter textbox.
3. If you do not want to add the data attribute just call the plugin directly.  $('#my-table').searchInTable();

Disclaimer

1. The purpose of this plugin is to add a very simple search for a table.  If you are looking for something more sofisticated try http://www.datatables.net/
